# Machine Learning Practices & Mini-Projects

This repository showcases practical machine learning work through mini-projects and experiments. It covers the full ML workflow including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Projects span core tasks such as regression, classification, and clustering, and include experiments in MLOps to support model deployment, monitoring, and reproducibility.

Youâ€™ll find:
- End-to-end notebooks with clear explanations
- Reusable Python scripts for common ML tasks
- Experiments with scalable ML workflows
